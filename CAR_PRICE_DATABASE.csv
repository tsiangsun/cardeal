(thats typically better than the epa rating.) the color is light metallic blue and paint is in good condition.#features:#-----------#5-speed manual transmission (hard-to-find and fun to drive)#power windows#power locks#power mirrors#electric power steering#power brakes#cruise control#air conditioning (works great)#front/rear/side air bags (high rating for crash protection)#tire pressure monitors#anti-lock brakes#tilt steering wheel#interior air filtration#tachometer#front and rear cup holders#the sport model added features:#-----------------------------------------#15 inch alloy wheels#am/fm/cd/mp3 with aux. audio jack. 200 watts output to 6 speakers#underbody and rear spoilers#front fog lights#keyless entry#leather-wrapped steering wheel#remote anti-theft alarm system#extras included that i purchased:#----------------------------------------#factory service manual ($200 value)#tire chains (never used)#rear rubber mat to protect carpet#wheel locks#custom windshield sun shade#factory paint-matched side molding (for parking lot ding protection)#honda roll-up cover for rear compartment (to hide luggage)

and gets 41mpg on the highway (31mpg city).#i am the sole owner and its had 100% highway miles...the tires; brakes; engine all feel brand new. it was previously a demo car for a honda dealership and was meticulously cared for by them. in fact; they sold the car to me with a full honda certified pre-owned warranty - this extends the standard 5 year/60;000 mile honda warranty to 7 years/100;000 miles; and you get this benefit passed onto you... http://www.hondacertified.com/program-benefits.aspx#with the honda sensing package; this car almost drives itself on the highway with adaptive cruise control that brakes automatically and keeps perfect pace with the cars in front; even in stop and go traffic - which drastically reduces driving fatigue. it also includes hondas lkas system that will steer for you automatically on the highway and keep you in the center of the lane. i bought it as a 2nd car for my long commute to san jose; but no longer need to make the commute. sad to part ways with it; but just dont need 2 cars anymore.#hondas hands-free bluetooth audio / phone and usb connection / charging will allow your cell phone to connect easily and stay charged. the car is spotless inside and out; and still has the new car smell. there is only 1 ding on the car (on the hood)...less then 1/4 inch in size due to a rock ding on the highway. please see the picture on this post.#no pets; no kids; no smoking. ever.#the price is firm...the value of the honda sensing package and honda certified pre-owned warranty alone makes this car worth at least $1;000 more than im asking. i have a loan on the vehicle; but im a business professional and will make the sale to you immediate and as simple as possible with the dmv process.#if you dont like wasting time; give me a call. its ready to view in downtown napa this saturday & sunday. thanks for your interest.##style name: sedan lx#make: honda#model: civic#model year: 2016#vehicle type: sedan#vehicle trim: lx#interior color: ivory#exterior color: burgundy night pearl#body type: sedan#engine:#mpg automatic city: 31#mpg automatic highway: 41#engine description: 2l 4 cylinder engine#fuel type: gasoline#fuel induction: sequential mpi#valves per cylinder: 4#aspiration: normal#drivetrain:#driven wheels: front-wheel#transmission: automatic#wheels rims: steel#wheels spare rim type: steel#drive train type: front wheel drive#suspension:#independent suspension: four-wheel#stabilizer bar: front and rear#instrumentation:#clock#external temp#low fuel level#tachometer#roof and glass:#front wipers: intermittent#privacy glass: light#rear defogger#in car entertainment:#antenna type: window grid#audio system: bluetooth/am/fm stereo#speakers: 4#seats:#drivers height: manual#seating capacity: 5#front seat type: bucket#upholstery: cloth#folding: fold forward seatback#convenience:#center console: full with covered storage#adaptive cruise control (acc) and lane keep assist (lkas)#cupholders: front#door pockets: driver;
